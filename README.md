# Badges for LaTeX4Ei

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow that periodically updates **last commit badges** for the [LaTeX4Ei organization](https://github.com/latex4ei). These badges help you see at a glance when each repo was last updated. They’re generated by [Shields.io](https://shields.io) and pushed to GitHub Pages for convenient embedding in docs or websites.

## How It Works

1. **Scheduled Workflow**  
   The workflow runs on a schedule (e.g., weekly) to fetch the latest commit info for each repository under the [LaTeX4Ei organization](https://github.com/latex4ei).

2. **Badge Generation**  
   Using [Shields.io](https://shields.io/), the workflow creates **custom badges** reflecting how long it’s been since the last commit. For example, older repos might get a red badge, while recently updated repos get a green badge.

3. **Publishing**  
   The generated badges are pushed to a branch configured for GitHub Pages. They’re then publicly accessible under a URL like:
   
   ```
   https://latex4ei.github.io/badges/last-commit/<REPO-NAME>.svg
   ```
   

## Usage

Embed it using Markdown:
```md
![Last Commit](https://latex4ei.github.io/badges/last-commit/<REPO-NAME>.svg)
```

For example:

![Last Commit](https://latex4ei.github.io/badges/last-commit/badges.svg)

## Website Integration

These badges are also displayed on the [LaTeX4Ei website](https://latex4ei.de).
